### Cholera Biomarkers: Enhancing Diagnosis and Treatment
Identifying key biomarkers for cholera, such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), Cholera Toxin (CT), OmpU and OmpT proteins, TcpA, and the ctxA and ctxB genes, is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy. These biomarkers help in the rapid detection of *Vibrio cholerae*, enabling timely intervention and better management of cholera outbreaks. 
By focusing on these biomarkers, we can develop more effective diagnostic tools and strategies to combat this persistent public health challenge.
